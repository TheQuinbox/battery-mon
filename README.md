# BatteryMon

This is a macOS application to periodically report your battery percentage using TTS.

## Installation

1. Grab the .zip from from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheQuinbox/battery-mon/releases).
2. Unzip it, and move the application into your `Applications` folder.
3. Open the application.

That should be it!

## Usage

The app lives in your menu bar. To access its settings or close it, simply click on its menu bar icon.

By default, it reports battery percentage changes in intervals of 10, but this can be changed from within the settings (accessible through the menu bar). It can report anywhere from every 1% to every 100% (i.e. only when your Mac is fully charged).
